# Haryana Police CMS — AI Agent Instructions

Welcome, Artificial Intelligence Coder! You are assisting a developer on the Haryana Police CMS project. Please read these strict rules before making any code modifications.

## 1. Database & Backend (CRITICAL)
- **Backend Architecture**: We use a lightweight local Express backend running via `server/index.js` which connects to an internal `better-sqlite3` database `data.db`.
- **API Endpoints**: All frontend queries should use standard `fetch` to `http://localhost:3000/api`. Do NOT attempt to install or use Supabase clients.
- **Data Persistence**: If you need to make schema changes, update the initialization configuration natively located inside `server/db.js`.
- **Test User Provisioning**: Ensure seed accounts are injected straight through initial `db.run()` logic if required.

## 2. Tech Stack and Patterns
- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite (NO Next.js, NO Server-Side Rendering)
- **UI Framework**: Ant Design (antd) + Lucide React icons
- **CSS**: Vanilla CSS modules or global overrides. Avoid Tailwind unless absolutely necessary.
- **Backend/DB**: Express + better-sqlite3 (SQLite).
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT authentication implementation. Tokens are stored in frontend `localStorage`.

## 3. Code Quality
- Deliver **COMPLETE, working code**. No placeholders like `// Add your logic here`.
- Ensure mobile-first responsiveness. Police officers will use this predominately on tablets and mobile phones.
- Use Role-Based Access Control logic (e.g. `<RoleGate allowedRoles={['io', 'sho']}>`) to show/hide features appropriately.

## 4. UI/UX Expectations
- Focus on premium aesthetics using the Ant Design components. Avoid plain HTML tables or generic inputs.
- Keep the interface simple and easy for non-technical users.
